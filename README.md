# Trackers

For use in a tool like [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net). Covers manually spotted
trackers, marketing bullshit and other nuisances. May be considered a bit
aggressive — but not too much. Shouldn't break any sites. If it does, just
manually whitelist. If something breaks the layout of Bloomberg, for example,
but I can still read the content properly, I couldn't care less. If a
questionable external dependency (or really, *any* external dependency) breaks
your layout: congratulations, your layout is crap and you're Doing it Wrong™.

Additionally, a separate domain list is available for really bad domain names 
that are probably not covered in other blocklists. And yes, I consider Facebook 
to be really bad, actively harmful, read: abusive. Like a spouse that hits and 
manipulates you, yet you constantly make up excuses and are afraid to leave. If 
at this point you don't, maybe it's time to reconsider your life choices and 
get help. There are people who will support your decision and life is better on 
the other side.

## Women Empowerment in Zanzibar

Send a little karma down the way and support women empowerment in Zanzibar by 
helping to [fund the local production of reusable female hygiene 
products](https://www.gofundme.com/f/women-empowerment-in-zanzibar). A very 
dear friend of mine runs the project. They were already able to buy hundreds of 
educational books. Sometimes, it takes so little to make a huge impact. If 
you'd like to thank me or support this work, donate. Additionally, any current 
and future sponsoring of my work via GitHub or other channels will flow one 
hundred percent to the NGO.
